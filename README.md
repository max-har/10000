# Rules for the dice game Ten Thousand

- The game is played with a total of 6 dice.
- The aim of the game is to reach 10,000 points in as few rounds as possible.
- A round begins with the first roll of all 6 dice.
- After each roll, at least one scoring die must be put away.
- The value of the individual dice and dice combinations is shown in the table below.
- If all dice have been successfully put away in one or more rolls, the round can be continued (again with all 6 dice).
- A round is over when either the accumulated points have been "written" or no points have been scored on a roll.
- Writing is only allowed from 350 points.
- If a double or a straight is thrown, this must be confirmed with at least 350 points. Rather, the accumulated points may not be written.

Here are the scores:

5 = 50 points
5 = 100 points

2 2 2 = 200 points
3 3 3 = 300 points
4 4 4 = 400 points
5 5 5 = 500 points
6 6 6 = 600 points
1 1 1 = 1,000 points
(each additional cube: +1,000 points)

Double (3 pairs):
1 1 2 3 3 = 1,500 points
2 2 4 6 6 = 1,500 points
â€¦

Street (1 to 6):
1 2 3 4 5 6 = 1,500 points
